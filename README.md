A parser and validator for the EU Digital Green Certificate (dgc) a.k.a. greenpass ðŸ“²âœ…

  - **Parses** the text content of a European Digital Green Certificate (dgc or greenpass) and extract the embedded data
  - Uses a **Trustlist** of **public keys** and **Elliptic Curve** cryptography to be able to validate the signature of a given certificate
  - It offers a **minimal and easy to use API**
  - The certificate data can be easily serialized/deserialized for ease of testing and reporting
  - It embeds the [official **valueset**](https://github.com/ehn-dcc-development/ehn-dcc-schema/) so that internal IDs (diseases, result types, countries, testing authorities, etc.) can be easily expanded to their descriptive equivalents
  - It reports errors for all fallible operations minimising the opportunity for panicking
  - Offers utilities for easily populate a Trustlist from various types of keys and apis
  - It's tested against the [official testing dataset](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-testdata)


Current limitations:

  - It only supports EC signatures (see [#2](https://github.com/lmammino/dgc/issues/2))
  - It does not support KID in the COSE unprotected header (see [#1](https://github.com/lmammino/dgc/issues/1))


## Dgc in action

TODO:
ADD examples ðŸ¤ž


## Usage
